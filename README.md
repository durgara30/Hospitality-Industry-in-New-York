# Hospitality-Industry-in-New-York
In this project, we'll analyze Airbnb data to understand vacation rental pricing factors using statistics and data visualization underlying patterns and emerging trends within the dataset. Through this analysis, we seek to enhance our comprehension of the various factors that impact the pricing dynamics of vacation rentals.
# Project Objective:
The goal of the Hospitality Industry Expansion into New York project is to analyze Airbnb's New York listings dataset, extracting insights about the vacation rental market. We employ statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to uncover pricing influencers.
# Presumptions
Our dataset exclusively encompasses residential units, where price corresponds to revenue. We make necessary assumptions to address business queries, taking into account the geopy module's potential installation. Comprehensive answers to all questions are provided, along with the complete Tableau file and PowerPoint presentation.
# Domain
This project is limited to New York State due to data constraints, concentrating solely on residential units listed on Airbnb. Hotels are excluded from the analysis due to the dataset's time frame.
# Drawbacks
Insights drawn from Airbnb data are subject to inherent limitations. Assumptions are made to address missing values and outliers. Data gaps regarding residential and commercial units necessitate additional assumptions.
